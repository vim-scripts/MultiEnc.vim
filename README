The Vim option 'fileencodings' has some limitations: e.g., it cannot autodetect GBK and Big5 files at the same time. This is my first motivation to write this script (and the support program tellenc).

This script does these things to decide the encoding of a file:

- If a file has a modeline fileencoding=..., it will be used as the encoding to open the file.
- If a file is an HTML file, and it has the encoding specified with a HTTP-EQUIV meta tag, it will be used as the encoding to open the file. The file pattern of HTML files can be customized by the global variable multienc_html_patterns.
- If a file cannot be decided by the steps above, tellenc may be used to decide its encoding. This includes HTML files without a suitable HTTP-EQUIV meta tag, and additional files can be detected with the global variable multienc_auto_patterns.
- A file can be manually autodetected with the command EditAutoEncoding (without a file name for the current buffer, or with a file name to edit a new file).
- The autodetection may be overridden with the command EditManualEncoding ("e ++enc=" may not work in some cases now).

The program used to tell the encoding of a file is "tellenc" by default. It can also be changed with the environment variable MULTIENC_TELLENC. My current tellenc, available at http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=&file=tellenc.zip, supports ASCII, UTF8, UTF-16, Latin1, Windows-1252, GB2312, GBK, Big5, and any Unicode encodings with BOM.
